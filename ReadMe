This projects makes assumption\n
1.distance is in x,y only no z axis involved.
2.no simulation of car moving around and getting free after a while
3.only get shortest distance car book that cab

REST API
Add cab to the system
localhost:8080/addcab
 {
	  "CarNumber":3,	 
	  "X":3,
	  "Y":3,
	  "FinalX":7,
	  "FinalY":7,
	  "Color":"red"
}
another record with great distance
 {
	  "CarNumber":7,	 
	  "X":300,
	  "Y":300,
	  "FinalX":700,
	  "FinalY":700,
	  "Color":"red"
}
{
	  "CarNumber":5,	 
	  "X":500,
	  "Y":500,
	  "FinalX":700,
	  "FinalY":700,
	  "Color":"red"
}

{
	  "CarNumber":5,	 
	  "X":1,
	  "Y":1,
	  "FinalX":3,
	  "FinalY":3,
	  "Color":"red"
}


This api is used for the booking of the cab
localhost:8080/bookcab
 {
	  
	  "X":1,
	  "Y":1,
	  "FinalX":5,
	  "FinalY":5,
	  "Color":""
}

#Unit test 
i was more interested to check if distance calculation is working correct so added test
bookingmanager_test.go
TestGetNearestCar()
Car is car pool array with car and their x,Y
make the request object which stands for user x,y coordinate
